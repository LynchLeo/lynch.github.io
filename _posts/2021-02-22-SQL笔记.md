# Introduction

## Data

* Three levels of data abstraction
  * Physical level focuses on the actual format and location of data
  * Logical level focuses on the meaning, content, and context of the data
  * View level focuses on simplifying the interaction with the system

* Logic view – data is organized into groups or categories
  * Character – single letter, number, or special character
  * __Field – group of related characters__
  * __Record – collection of related fields__
  * __Table – collection of related records__
  * __Database – integrated collection of logically related tables__

* __Key Field__ or Primary Key (the “Unique identifier”)
  * Used to create relationships between tables

* Batch versus Real-Time Processing
  * In batch processing, data is collected over several hours, days, or even weeks. It is then processed all at once as a “batch.”
  * In real-time processing, also known as online processing, data is processed at the same time the transaction occurs. 

## Database

* Collection of integrated data
  * Logically related files and records

* Databases address
  * data redundancy – same information in multiple files
  * data integrity – accurate updating of files

* Advantages to having databases
  * Sharing – between departments of an organization
  * Security – limited access
  * Less data redundancy – decrease unnecessary duplication
  * Data integrity – reduce the likelihood of inaccurate data

## Database Management System (DBMS)

* A database management system (DBMS) is the software for creating, modifying, and gaining access to the database.
* A DBMS consists of five subsystems:
  * DBMS engine provides a bridge between logical and physical data views.
  * Data definition subsystem defines the logical structure of a database using a data dictionary or schema.
  * Data manipulation subsystem provides tools for data maintenance and data analysis;
    * tools include query-by-example and structured query language (SQL).
  * Application generation subsystem provides tools for creating data entry forms with specialized programming languages.
  * Data administration subsystem manages the database;
    * database administrators (DBAs) are computer professionals who help define processing rights and access rights of data in the database.

## Common Database Models

* Hierarchical database
  * Fields or records structured in nodes
    * Nodes - points connected like branches of an upsidedown tree
    * One parent per node
    * Parent can have several child nodes
      * One-to-many relationship
  * Major concern is that if your parent node is deleted then so are all subordinate child nodes

* Network database
  * Hierarchical node arrangement
    * Each child node may have more than one parent node
      * Many-to-many relationship
  * Additional connections between parent and child are Pointers
  * Nodes can be reached through multiple paths

* Relational database
  * A more flexible type where there are no access paths down a hierarchy
    * Data stored in table called a relation
    * Tables consist of rows and columns
    * Tables related via a common data item / key field

* Multidimensional database
  * A variation and an extension of the relational model
  * Includes a data cube
    * Extension of the two-dimensional data model to include additional or multiple dimensions
  * Good for representing complex relationships
  * Advantages over relational databases
    * Conceptualization provides users with an intuitive model in which complex data and relationships can be conceptualized
    * Processing speed for analyzing and querying a large multidimensional database is faster

* Object-oriented database
  * Store data as well as instructions to manipulate data
  * Organize data using
    * Classes – general definitions
    * Objects – specific instances of class containing data and instructions to manipulate the data
    * Attributes – data fields an object possesses
    * Methods – instructions for retrieving or manipulating attribute values

## Types of Databases

* Individual or Persona Computer Database
  * Integrated files used by just one person
* Company Database
  * Common operational or commonly used files shared in an organization
* Distributed Database
  * Database spread geographically and accessed using database server
    * All the data in a database is not physically located in one place
* Commercial or Information Utilities or Data Banks
  * Enormous database that organizations develop to cover particular subjects such as
    * Dialog Information Services
    * Dow Jones Interactive Publishing
    * Lexis Nexis

## Relational Model

* All the data is stored in various tables.
* Example of tabular data in the relational model

* Instances and Schemas
  * Like types and variables in programming languages
  * Logical Schema – the overall logical structure of the database
    * Example: The database consists of information about a set of customers and accounts in a bank and the relationship between them
      * Analogous to type information of a variable in a program
  * Physical schema – the overall physical structure of the database
  * Instance – the actual content of the database at a particular point in time
    * Analogous to the value of a variable

# 基础语句

## SELECT

> 从数据库中选取数据。

格式：

```sql
SELECT column_name,column_name 
FROM table_name;
```

实际运用：

```sql
SELECT * FROM section;
SELECT course_id FROM section;
SELECT course_id, room_number FROM section;
```

### DISTINCT

> 列出不重复的值。

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM section;
SELECT DISTINCT sec_id FROM section;
SELECT DISTINCT sec_id, building FROM section;
```

## WHERE

> 提取满足指定条件的记录。

格式：

```sql
SELECT column_name,column_name 
FROM table_name 
WHERE column_name operator value;
```

实际运用：

```sql
-- 文本须加引号，区分大小写。
SELECT * FROM section WHERE semester = 'Fall';
-- 错误的写法: SELECT * FROM section WHERE semester = Fall;

-- 数值可以加引号，最好不加。
SELECT * FROM section WHERE sec_id = 2;
SELECT * FROM section WHERE sec_id = '2';
```

### = 或 IS

```sql
SELECT * FROM section WHERE sec_id IS NULL;
```

### <> 或 !=

```sql
SELECT * FROM section WHERE sec_id <> 1;
```

### < ， > ， <= ， >=

```sql
SELECT * FROM time_slot WHERE start_hr > 13;
```

### BETWEEN ... AND ...

> 包含边界。

```sql
SELECT * FROM time_slot WHERE start_hr BETWEEN 13 AND 16;
```

### LIKE 加 % 或 \_

> % 表示多个字符，\_ 表示一个字符

```sql
SELECT * FROM instructor WHERE dept_name LIKE '%sic%';
SELECT * FROM instructor WHERE dept_name LIKE 'His%';
SELECT * FROM instructor WHERE dept_name LIKE '%o_y';
```

### IN()

> 和 OR 加 = 一个效果

```sql
SELECT * FROM instructor WHERE dept_name IN('Music', 'History');
SELECT * FROM instructor WHERE dept_name IS 'Music' OR dept_name IS 'History';
```

### () , NOT , AND , OR

> 优先级：() > NOT > AND > OR

```sql
SELECT * FROM instructor WHERE salary > 70000 AND NOT dept_name LIKE '%sic%';
```

## ORDER BY

> 排序。默认为正序ASC，DESC为倒序。只对其紧跟着的第一个列名有效，其他不受影响。

格式：

```sql
SELECT column_name,column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name,column_name ASC|DESC;
```

实际运用：

```sql
SELECT * FROM time_slot;
SELECT * FROM time_slot ORDER BY start_hr DESC, day;
```

## INSERT INTO

> 向表中插入新记录。如果列出插入行的每一列数据，则不需要指定列名。

格式：

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1,column2,column3,...)
VALUES (value1,value2,value3,...);
```

实际运用：

```sql
SELECT * FROM section;
INSERT INTO section (course_id, sec_id, semester, year, time_slot_id) VALUES ('BIO-201', 2, 'Fall', 2018, 'D');
SELECT * FROM section;
INSERT INTO section VALUES ('BIO-401', 2, 'Fall', 2018, 'Packard', 100, 'D');
SELECT * FROM section;
```

## UPDATE

> 更新表中已存在的记录。

格式：

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1=value1,column2=value2,...
WHERE some_column=some_value;
```

实际运用：

```sql
SELECT * FROM section;
UPDATE section SET semester = 'Winter', time_slot_id = 'A' WHERE room_number = 101;
SELECT * FROM section;
```

> 如果省略 WHERE 子句，所有的记录都将被更新，因此一定要注意

```sql
SELECT * FROM section;
UPDATE section SET semester = 'Winter', time_slot_id = 'A';
SELECT * FROM section;
```

## DELETE

> 删除表中的记录

格式：

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE some_column=some_value;
```

实际运用：

```sql
SELECT * FROM section;
DELETE FROM section WHERE semester = 'Fall';
SELECT * FROM section;
```

> 同样，如果省略 WHERE 子句，所有的记录都将被删除，因此一定要注意。<br>除此之外，删除操作无法撤销，也需要注意
